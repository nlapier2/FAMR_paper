# FAMR_paper

This repository contains scripts used to generate results in the FAMR paper,
as well as some of the results themselves, where feasible.

To run the scripts pertaining to FAMR-Susie, you will need to install the FAMR
package, which can be found here: https://github.com/nlapier2/FAMR/

For more details on the method, see the paper: (forthcoming)

High-level organization:

* simulation_scripts/ contains scripts used to run simulations and evaluate
the results

* real_data_scripts/ contains scripts to pre-process real data into the desired
format, as well as to run FAMR-Susie and other methods on this data.

* results/ contains the script used to generate plots for the paper, as well
as the summarized results generated by the simulation or real data scripts that
were used as input. Some results files were too large to be included raw, so
only processed summaries are provided, as well as the scripts used to generate
those summaries.

Each of these folders contains their own README file with further details.
