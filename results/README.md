# Results and plotting scripts for the FAMR paper

`gen_plots.R` contains code to generate most of the plots shown in the FAMR
paper. Summarized/processed results are shown in the `results/` folder.
Given these results, the user can simply run `Rscript gen_plots.R` to
generate the plots. They will appear in `plot_images/`.
This may take a couple minutes to run.

Some of the raw results files were too large to include here, so we use only the
summarized results that were directly input into the plotting script in those 
cases. Raw results can be generated by following instructions in the
`simulation_results/` and `real_data_results/` folders in this repo.
